# ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ

I am Gurkirat Singh, currently working as a Software Engineer @instabase. I have specific interests in large scale cloud first distributed systems & applied AI. Graduated from IIITH with CGPA of 9.65 (top 5%). 
I have also first authored papers in computer vision & robotics published at top conferences like WACV & ACC.

I like to solve complex problems with simple and elegant solutions. You don't need to build a whole crane to go to top floor yes? Just build a ladder :)
